### 1. Routing in React - 

Routing in React is a way to manage and navigate between different views or components in a React application. It allows you to build a single-page application with multiple views without reloading the entire page. The most popular library for routing in React is react-router-dom.

### Basic Setup
To get started with routing in a React application, you need to wrap your application with the BrowserRouter component. This component enables the use of the router throughout your app.
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
